RULES OF THE GAME:

1. The goal of the game is to add up your cards to the largest number without going over 21.

2. If the cards in your hand add up to more than 21, then it's called a bust. It means that you lose immediately.

3. All the cards from 2 to 10 count as their face value.

4. Jack, Queen and King each count as 10.

5. Ace is a special card. The Ace can either count as a one towards your total, or it can count as an 11.

6. Depending on whether, if you've gone over 21 or whether if you're under 21, you can decide which value you want your Ace to represent.
